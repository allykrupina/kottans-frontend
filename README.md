This repository is created to reflect the process of my Kottans Front-End Course tasks completion.

Git and GitHub

The fulfillment of the Task 0 - Git and Git Hub helped me to get new useful knowledge concerning work with Git. 

I knew some new commands such - "git tag", - "git cherry-pick", - "git describe", arguments for push and fetch etc. 

Most useful info for me was about merging conflicts as it is often problematic especially while working on the project in a team.

Also I have got a better understanding of git commits ('one commit per logical change') and that 'branch early and branch often'.

I liked the course of [UDACITY], it contains much theoretical info while [try.github.io] helps to get some practice so It was useful to do exercises on the GitHub Learning Lab.
